        <p>This was the game I created while learning unreal engine. This  game was the final result of the course i was learning from UDEMY.This game have third person shooting with RPG-like enemies which attacks Player when close enough or if triggered by the player shooting. In this player have to kill all the enemies without dying. Enemies health, size and speed increases with closing distance from winning, which increases dificulty level for the player.</p>
